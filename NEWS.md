# apabayes 0.0.0.9000

* feat: `apa_tidy()` reports an easystats **result object** — the table
  `bayestestR::describe_posterior()` or `parameters::model_parameters()`
  already computed — and not only a fitted model. Because every Bayesian
  model easystats can summarise returns a table inheriting
  `describe_posterior`, this one route covers model classes apabayes has
  no fit method for. Nothing is recomputed: the estimates, interval,
  `pd`, ROPE percentage and diagnostics are read off the table, and the
  reporting settings with them, so the method takes no `ci`, `ci_level`,
  `rope` or `diagnostics` argument. `centrality = NULL` reports whichever
  of the median and the mean the table holds and asks you to name one
  when it holds both. `ess_bulk` is always `NA` — no easystats table
  carries it; pass the fit for both ESS columns. A `parameters_model`
  table that is *not* a posterior summary (a frequentist model, or one
  computed with several `ci` levels) is refused rather than coerced to
  draws, which is what the coercing default would otherwise do to it.
* feat: `apa_tidy()` gains a `stanreg` method for rstanarm fits, the
  third route of the extract layer, with the brmsfit method's signature.
  Estimates, interval, pd and the optional ROPE come from
  `parameters::model_parameters()`, always called with `priors = FALSE`
  (the prior merge appends junk `NA` rows under `effects = "random"`)
  and `component = "all"` (the bare easystats default omits `sigma` on
  this class). R-hat and both ESS columns come from
  `posterior::summarise_draws()` over the fit's draws rather than from
  `bayestestR::diagnostic_posterior()`, which never covers `sigma` on a
  stanreg and disagrees numerically with `posterior` on the terms it
  does cover; every reported parameter therefore has a diagnostic.
  `apa_tidy_diagnostics()` already handled stanreg through its default
  method, so there is no `stanreg` method for it.
* internal: the brmsfit route's label derivation, optional-column
  reading and `variables =` resolution move to `R/extract-shared.R` as
  `parameters_labels()`, `optional_column()` and
  `resolve_parameters_variables()`, ahead of the stanreg route that uses
  them unchanged. No behaviour change.
* fix: `apa_tidy(fit, effects = "random")` on a model without random
  effects now says so ("`effects` is "random", but `x` has no random
  effects.") instead of surfacing easystats' `'by' must specify a
  uniquely valid column`. The check is `insight::is_mixed_model()` on
  the model formula, run before easystats is called; `insight` moves
  from Suggests to Imports for it, and `rstanarm` joins Suggests.
* internal: the shape every parameters route repeats — check the
  reporting arguments, call easystats once, match rows by name, assemble
  the contract columns — moves into `R/extract-shared.R`, and the
  `apabayes_tidy()` constructor splits out its input checks and its
  column assembly. No behaviour change: the same 585 tests pass either
  side of the refactor.
* feat: `apa_tidy()` gains a `brmsfit` method, the second route of the
  extract layer. Estimates, interval, pd and the optional ROPE come from
  `parameters::model_parameters()`; because that call returns no
  `ESS_bulk` column, R-hat and both ESS columns come from a second call
  to `bayestestR::diagnostic_posterior()`, joined by parameter name
  rather than by position (its row order differs and its default omits
  `sigma`). The `effects` and `group` columns are read defensively: they
  exist only for a model with random effects, and `""` becomes `NA`.
  Display labels come from the `pretty_names` attribute, disambiguated by
  group where two parameters share a label, so the inline layer's
  term-or-label addressing stays unique.
* feat: `apa_tidy_diagnostics()`, a generic for convergence diagnostics
  alone, with a coercing `default` method for anything
  `posterior::as_draws_df()` accepts and a `runjags` method. Its tables
  carry no interval, so `ci_method` and `ci_level` are `NA` and the print
  header does not claim an interval that is not there.
* feat: extract layer, tidy contract and draws route (Milestone 2).
  `apabayes_tidy()` builds the object the extract layer hands to the
  format, inline and table layers: a tibble whose columns are fixed by
  `type` (`"parameters"`, `"diagnostics"`, `"hypotheses"`, `"loo"`,
  `"bf_models"`, `"sem_fit"`, `"contrasts"`), with the reporting metadata
  as attributes. `validate_apabayes_tidy()` is the check every consumer
  runs on entry, `is_apabayes_tidy()` the predicate, and
  `print.apabayes_tidy()` writes what the numbers are above the tibble.
* feat: `apa_tidy()`, the extract generic, with methods for `draws`
  objects, a coercing `default` method for anything
  `posterior::as_draws_df()` accepts (`stanfit`, `CmdStanFit`, `mcmc`,
  `mcmc.list`, matrices, data frames) and one for `runjags`. Estimates,
  interval, pd and the ROPE percentage come from
  `bayestestR::describe_posterior()`, R-hat and ESS from
  `posterior::summarise_draws()`. Sampler variables (`lp__`, `lprior`,
  `prior_*`) are dropped by default and reported when named in
  `variables`.
* fix: `apabayes_tidy()` and `apa_tidy()` returned their table invisibly,
  so a bare call at the console printed nothing. Both now return visibly
  and reach `print.apabayes_tidy()`.
* feat: format layer (Milestone 1). `apa_num()`, `apa_p()`, `apa_pd()`,
  `apa_prob()`, `apa_ci()`, `apa_bf()`, `apa_er()` and `apa_rhat_ess()`
  turn numbers into APA-style text for four markup targets (`md`,
  `latex`, `typst`, `plain`), chosen from the `markup` argument,
  `options(apabayes.markup = )` or the knitr output format. `apa_bf()`
  prints Bayes factors as numbers only, with `direction = "01"` for
  BF01; `apa_bf_label()` is the opt-in helper that returns a verbal
  category from a named scheme (`"jeffreys"`, `"raftery"`), with the
  caveat on its help page.
